With Your Help, We Can Do More

### Body Copy

BARB is a not-for-profit organisation working to regulate the field of behaviour therapy and expand access to qualified, certified professionals. We don’t sell services. We raise standards, train therapists, and protect families.

With your help, we can do more; reach more districts, educate more parents, and certify more professionals. As Sri Lanka’s only official regulatory body for behaviour therapy, we rely on partnerships, donations, and sponsorships to deliver on a bold, necessary mission:

Regulate a growing field

Train and certify ethical professionals

Protect families through credible, science-backed care

# SECTION 3 – THE NEED

By contributing to BARB, you help:

Train and certify new behaviour therapists

Educate the public about ethical behavioural care

Strengthen oversight and ethical accountability

Expand access to underserved regions

Partner with institutions shaping the future of mental and developmental health
