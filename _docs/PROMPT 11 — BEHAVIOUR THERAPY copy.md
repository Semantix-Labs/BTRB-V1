# SECTION 1 – WHAT IS BEHAVIOUR THERAPY?

### Crosshead

What is Behaviour Therapy?

### Body Copy

Behaviour Therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on using the scientific principles of learning such as classical and operant conditioning to modify behaviour.

Instead of focusing on underlying psychological causes, this therapy zeros in on the observable behaviour itself and the environmental factors that trigger and reinforce it. The goal is to reduce unwanted symptoms and change maladaptive behaviour patterns.

Common techniques used within this broad approach include:
    Systematic Desensitisation
    Behaviour Rehearsal
    Modelling
    Biofeedback

Precise Assessment: Identifying the function of a behaviour.

Planned Intervention: Developing specific strategies for change.

Continuous Measurement: Objectively tracking progress with data.

They then:

Design a personalised intervention plan

Use reinforcement to increase desired behaviours

Track progress with data

Adjust interventions over time for long-term success

# SECTION 5 – THE IMPORTANCE OF CERTIFICATION

The Importance of Certification

Because behaviour therapy is powerful and highly technical it must be delivered by trained professionals. Unqualified providers can unintentionally cause harm. That’s why BARB exists: to regulate, certify, and protect.
