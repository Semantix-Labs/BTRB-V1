# SECTION 4 – GRANDPARENTING PATHWAY

### Crosshead

Grandparenting Pathway (Limited Time Only)

During BARB’s initial rollout, experienced practitioners may be admitted via a review process. Apply early if you believe you qualify.

The Grandparenting Pathway has been introduced to recognise professionals who have contributed to the field of behaviour therapy but may not yet meet the full criteria for direct certification. This pathway is available for a limited period of four (4) years during BTRB’s initial rollout.

---

## Membership Progression

All applicants admitted via the Grandparenting Pathway will initially be granted Associate Membership.

Once you complete the 40-hour ABA course and obtain a recognized ABA credential, your status may be upgraded to Full Membership, following BARB’s review and approval process.

---

## Important Notes:

Supervision is not mandatory during the Grandparenting period; however, once the four-year phase concludes, mandatory supervision will apply for all Registered Behaviour Therapists and Analysts.

After the four-year window closes, the Grandparenting Pathway will no longer be available, and only professionals with active, recognised licenses will be eligible for certification.

---

# SECTION 5 – PREVIOUSLY CERTIFIED PROFESSIONALS

### Crosshead

For Previously Certified Professionals

If you hold an expired ABA qualification (such as RBT, IBT, IBA, or BCBA) or have paused your professional practice, you can still apply through this pathway. You will be required to:

Sit for a basic ABA knowledge examination to refresh and validate your expertise

Complete an Ethics and Professional Conduct exam

Attend an interview to review your practical experience and professional background

Upon approval, you’ll receive Associate Membership with BARB and can work toward Full Membership by completing the required training within the 4-year period.

# SECTION 6 – EXPERIENCED BUT UNCREDENTIALED PRACTITIONERS

### Crosshead

For Experienced but Uncredentialed Practitioners

You’ll need to:

Demonstrate relevant work experience and supporting documentation
