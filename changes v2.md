Could the logo in the header section please be increased slightly  so it appears more visible and prominent?

On the home page, we would prefer the “Behaviour Analysis Registration Board” name to appear in a single solid colour instead of the current gradient effect.

On both the Home and About pages, please change “Become A Certified Therapist” to “Become Certified.”

On the About page under “Vision,” please change the capital “S” in “Science” to a lowercase “s.”

On the About page, in the final paragraph, kindly remove the words “and the Global South.”

In the Donate section under “Impact Snapshot,” please update “10+ certified professionals trained in 2024” to “30+ certified professionals trained in 2024.”

We would also like to update the profile data and photos of the professionals guiding BARB. 

I have included the revised profile information and photos for Dr. Anton and Chrystal (CJ) Honsaker below.
