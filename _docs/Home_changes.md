SECTION 3 – BEHAVIOUR THERAPY OVERVIEW

Behaviour Therapy: Scientific. Applied. Individualised.

Body Copy

Behaviour therapy helps individuals especially children build the skills they need to thrive. Rooted in the science of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), it uses data-driven strategies to change behaviours that affect daily life, from social skills to emotional regulation.

SECTION 5 – ETHICS & REGULATION

Setting The Standard For Ethical Behaviour Therapy

Body Copy

In the absence of regulation, anyone can call themselves a behaviour therapist. This leaves families vulnerable and the profession at risk.

That’s where BARB comes in. Our role is to set the standard, hold professionals accountable, and protect the people who rely on us.
